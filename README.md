# sortDraw
Visualization of standard sorting algorithms using CodeDraw

## Attention! This implementation requires the CodeDraw library

## Purpose
This program should help beginners to understand the logic behind elementary sort algorithms.
Other then CodeDraw and Arrays, no OOP techniques should be used, since students of programming-101 classes should be able to read and adapt the code.

WIP - insertion sort, bubble sort, selection sort are to be visualized first.
Merge sort is planned to be included too, with a slightly different visualization pattern.
