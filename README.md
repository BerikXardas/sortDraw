## Purpose
This program should help beginners to understand the logic behind elementary sort algorithms bubble sort, selection sort and insertion sort, as well as merge sort and quick sort.

Other then CodeDraw and Arrays, no OOP techniques should be used, since students of programming-101 classes should be able to read and adapt the code.
